Luck plays `some` role in life. I think everyone should acknowledge that. Your success may not be completely arbitrary but I think there is some part of luck. I liked [Michael Lewis's speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ_T5C3hIM) about the life's mysterious outcomes. I know this video for long time, but just wanted to write about it.

But you can't depend on luck. You have to give your best -- atleast try. I think luck is secret ingredient that ensures your best actions are rewarded. We can give many examples that showcase the role of luck in one's life. Sometimes, in life, despite of your best efforts, you may not be rewarded, just becase you are unlucky. So, prepare yourself to give your best and let luck help you!
