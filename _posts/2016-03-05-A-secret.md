We are not convinced about something implies that we need more information about it.

We are in need of more information implies that, that something we are interested in, must be holding some secrets.

You gathered all necessary information implies that you *"knew"* the secrets.

Everything we don't know is a secret. So, be enthusiastic to know the secrets.

Because I think, this is how *"the gaints on whose shoulders we all are standing on"* worked all the things we all are convinced with.

Secrecy always attracts. But you have to feel everything you want to know is *a "secret"*.

**It is a mystery &mdash; but only till we don't know about it.**
