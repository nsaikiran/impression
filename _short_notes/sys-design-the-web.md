When it comes to software, the frontend or the user interface has a crucial role to play. With computers, the visual user interface mattered, but now -- the gadgets like mobile phones, wearables, and features like AI based voice assistants, text to voice and voice to text features etc, we need to understand that the 'visual' user interface is not the only required user interface. And, we need to make sure that our content can be consumed in all the standard user interfaces.
There is great material about Web accessibility, "how fast the webpage is ready to interact" and reducing the response time and vulnerabilities. We can refer [Scott Davis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottdavis99/)'s [ThirstyHead](https://thirstyhead.com/). His talks and blogs are very informative.
Points learned: Framework free web - using browser native features and making the web a lot faster. Browser native features also provide best accessibility features.
